## 1 - Introduction
<a name="intro"></a>

All the code is in the namespace `homog2d`, so either add `using namespace homog2d`, either use it as a prefix on each type.

This library provides several data types: lines, points, segments, and homography matrices, that can be used to transform (planar transformation) one of the basic types.
It is implemented as a homogeneous 3x3 matrix.

## 2 - Lines and points
<a name="basic"></a>

- Create a 2D point:
```C++
Point2d pt1;       // 0,0
Point2d pt2(3,4);
```

- Create a 2D line:
```C++
Line2d li1;             // vertical line at x=0
Line2d li2( 3, 4 );     // line passing through (0,0) and (3,4)
```

- Create a point from two lines, and a line from two points:
```C++
Point2d pt3( li1, li2 );
Line2d  li3( pt1, pt2 );
```

- Get a line from two points, and a point from two lines:
```C++
pt1 = li1 * li2;
li1 = pt1 * pt2;
```

Beware, two parallel lines will never cross, and two identical points do not define a line.
So if your code attempts to do so, this will trigger a
[std::runtime_error](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/runtime_error)
exception.<br>
If you are unsure, you can check first:
```C++
if( li1.isParallelTo(li2) )
	cout << "Lines are parallel !\n";
```
For the numerical considerations on this test (that actually computes the angle between the two lines),
check below, section [Numerical data types](#numdt).

- Add some offset to a line:
```C++
li1.addOffset( OD_Horiz, 5 ); // horizontal offset
li1.addOffset( OD_Vert, 5 ); // vertical offset
```

- Compute distances from line to point or from point to point:
```C++
Line2d li;        // some line
Point2d pt1, pt2; // some points
auto dist1 = li1.distTo( pt1 );   // distance from line to point
auto dist2 = pt1.distTo( li1 );   // but you can do this too
auto dist2 = pt2.distTo( pt1 );   // distance from point to point

Line2d li2;
// auto dist = li.distTo( li2 );   // this does not build !
```

### Get point(s) lying on line

To get a point lying on a line, you can provide one of its coordinates and get the other coordinate value, using the enum
`En_GivenCoord`.
For example, if you build the line going through (0,0)-(4,2) with:

```C++
Line2d li(4,2);
```
You can compute the coordinate of y for x=2 with:
```C++
auto y = li.getCoord( GC_X, 2 );
```
of get the coordinate of x for y=1 with:
```C++
auto x = li.getCoord( GC_Y, 1 );
```

You can also get directly the point with:
```C++
Point2d pt2 = li.getPoint( GC_X, 2 );
```

The values `GC_Y`,`GC_Y` are just a two-values `enum`.

### Points at equal distance from a point on line
<a name="paedfapol"></a>

You can compute the two points that are lying on a line and at a given distance from a point.

![fig](misc/fig1.png)

The "middle" point must be given as either its x or y coordinate [(1)](#fn1).
```C++
Line2d li( ..., ... ); // some line
auto ppts = li.getPoints( GC_X, coord, dist ); // returns a std::pair
Point2d p1 = ppts.first;
Point2d p2 = ppts.second;
```

Upon return, the "first" point will hold the one with smallest 'x' coordinates, or the smallest 'y' coordinates if x coordinates are equal.

### Orthogonal and parallel lines, angles between two lines

You can compute a line orthogonal to another one at a given coordinate, using the above enum.
For example, this:
```C++
Line2d li2 = li.getOrthogonalLine( GC_X, 2 );
```
will build `li2` so that it is orthogonal to `li` at `x=2`.


You can get a line parallel to another one with the member function `getParallelLine()`.
This function takes as argument a point that the line will intersect.

```C++
Line2d li1; // some line
Point2d pt; // some point
Line2d li2 = li1.getParallelLine( pt ); // pt will be lying on li2, wich is parallel to li1
```

You can compute the angle in Radians between two lines, either with a member function or with a free function:
```C++
auto angle1 = li2.getAngle( li1 );
auto angle2 = getAngle( li1, li2 );
```

You can check if a line is parallel to another line:
```C++
Line2d l1,l2; // some lines
bool it_is = l1.isParallelTo( l2 );
```

## 3 - Segments
<a name="segments"></a>

A segment is implemented internally as a pair of points.
Usage is straightforward:
```C++
Segment s1( Point2d(12,34), Point2d(45,67) );
Segment s2; // default value
std::cout << s2;  // prints "(0,0) - (1,1)"
s2.set( Point2d(12,34), Point2d(45,67) );
```
You can get the pair of points (as an `std::pair`) with `get()`.
Internally, the points are stored with the "smallest" one as first (using x coordinate, or, if equal, using y coordinate):
```C++
Segment s1( Point2d(100,100), Point2d(10,10) );
auto pair= s1.get();
std::cout << pair.first; // will print (10,10)
```

Many operations available with lines can apply to segments too:
```C++
Segment s1( Point2d(12,34), Point2d(45,67) );
Line2d l1 = s1.getLine();  // get supporting line
bool b1 = l1.isParallelTo( s1 );
bool b2 = s1.isParallelTo( l1 );  // also works
auto a1 = l1.getAngle( s1 );
auto a2 = s1.getAngle( l1 );
```

## 4 - Homographies
<a name="matrix"></a>

You can manipulate 2D transformations as 3x3 homogeneous matrices (aka "Homography").
The three planar transformations (rotation, translation, scaling) are available directly through provided member functions.
They are available in two forms: "`setXxxx()`" and "`addXxxx()`".
The first one starts from the identity transformation and builds the requested one.
The second form adds the requested transformation to the matrix.

- First example:
```C++
Homogr h; // unit transformation ("eye" matrix)
h.setTranslation(3,4);
Point2d pt1(1,2);
Point2d pt2 = h * pt1; // pt2 is now (4,6)
h.init(); // reset to unit transformation
```

You can create a rotation or a scale transformation with one of these:
```C++
Homogr h;
h.setRotation( 3.14 ); // angle of PI radians
h.setScale( 2., 3. ); // discard previous rotation, and set horizontal scale factor to 2. and vertical to 3.
```

- You can build some complex transformation by multiplying these:
```C++
Homogr h; // unit transformation
h.setTranslation(3,4);
Homogr h2( 45. * M_PI / 180.); // 45Â° rotation matrix
Homogr h3a = h1*h2; // first, rotation, then translation
Homogr h3b = h2*h1; // first, translation, then rotation
```

Or by calling dedicated member functions:
```C++
Homogr h;
h.addRotation( 3.14 );       // angle of PI radians (would be identical with "set")
h.addScale( 2., 3. );        // add scaling transformation
h.addTranslation( 0., 4. );  // add translation
```

- But you can also used "chained" syntax:
```C++
Homogr h; // unit transformation
h.addTranslation(3,4).addRotation( 45. * M_PI / 180.).addTranslation(-3,-4);
```

- You can access individual values of the matrix (read or write).
This is needed if you want to set up some specific transformation (shearing, perspective, whatever):
```C++
h.set( 0, 0, 3.14 );  // sets value at first line, first col
auto v = h.get( 0, 0 ); // 3.14
```

To fill the matrix with arbitrary values, the best is to build it from a "vector of vectors", as in the example below:
```C++
std::vector<std::vector<float>> m = {
	{ 1,  0,  2 },
	{ 0,  1, -1 },
	{ 0,  0,  1 }
};
Homogr F = m;
```
You can also use `std::array` if needed.

- You can compute the inverse and/or the transpose of the matrix:
```C++
h.inverse();
h.transpose();
h.inverse().transpose(); // first, invert, second, transpose
```

- Once you have set up your matrix, you can apply it to points (or lines), using the `*` operator:
```C++
Homogr F; // set up some transformation
Point2d p1;
Point2d p2 = H * p1;
```

- You can apply the homography to a set of points or lines:
```C++
std::vector<Point2d> v_pts;
... // fill with values
h.applyTo( v_pts );
```
This actually works with any other container on whom one can iterate, such as `std::array` or `std::list`.


Three constructors are provided:
* one without arguments, that initializes the matrix to a unit transformation;
* one with **one** floating point argument, that produces a rotation matrix of the given angle value;
* one with **two** floating point arguments, that produces a translation matrix with the given values.

```C++
Homogr Hr( 1. ); // rotation matrix of 1 radian
Homogr Ht( 3., 4. ); // translation matrix of tx=3, ty=4
```


## 5 - Computation of intersection points
<a name="inter"></a>

### Intersection of lines with flat rectangles

You can compute the intersection of a line with a flat rectangle defined by two points with the
`intersectsRectangle()` member function.
It will return a `Intersect` object that holds the intersection points.

Usage:

```C++
Line2d li( ..., ... ); // some line
Point2d pt1(1,1);
Point2d pt2(8,8);
auto ri = li.intersectsRectangle( pt1, pt2 );
if( ri() )  // means the line does intersect the rectangle defined by (1,1)-(8,1)-(8,8)-(1,8)
{
	Point2d intersect_pt1 = ri.get().first;
	Point2d intersect_pt2 = ri.get().second;
}
```

You don't have to give the bottom-right, top-left corners of the rectangle, the function checks and automatically computes these two points.
In the example above, you could have as well given the points (1,8)-(8,1), the result would have been the same.
The only requirement is that no coordinate must be the same in the two points.

### Intersection of a line with a circle

For a line `li`, you can compute the intersection points with a circle having a radius `rad` and located at `pt` with the following code:
```C++
auto ri = li.intersectsCircle( pt, rad );
if( ri() )   // means the line intersects the circle
{
	auto inter = ri.get(); // returns a std::pair
	Point2d intersect_pt1 = inter.first;
	Point2d intersect_pt2 = inter.second;
}
```

Also see the provided demo for a runnable example.


For both of these functions, the returned pair of intersection points will always hold as "first" the point with the lowest `x` value, and if equal, the point if the lowest `y` value.


### Points and rectangles

You can quickly check if a points lies within a flat rectangle defined by two points `p1`,`p2` with:
```C++
bool b = pt.isInsideRectangle( p1, p2 );
```
Again, the two points can be any of the four corners of the rectangle.

This function will return for all points lying on edges of the rectangle.


## 6 - Bindings with other libraries
<a name="bind"></a>

Import from other types is pretty much straight forward.
For points, a templated constructor is provided that can be used with any type having an 'x' and 'y' member.
For homographies, you can import directly from
`std::vector<std::vector<T>>` or `std::array<std::array<T,3>,3>`.

For the first case, it is mandatory that all the vectors sizes are equal to 3 (the 3 embedded ones and the global one).

### Data conversion from/to Opencv

Optional functions are provided to interface with [Opencv](https://opencv.org).
These features are enabled by defining the symbol `HOMOG2D_USE_OPENCV` at build time, before "#include"'ing the file.
You can then write this:
```C++
Point2d pt;
...
cv::Point2d ptcv1 = pt.getCvPtd(); // double coordinates
cv::Point2f ptcv2 = pt.getCvPtf(); // float coordinates
cv::Point2f ptcv3 = pt.getCvPti(); // integer coordinates
```

This is also available as free functions:
```C++
Point2d pt;
...
cv::Point2d ptcv1 = getCvPtd(pt);
cv::Point2f ptcv2 = getCvPtf(pt);
cv::Point2f ptcv3 = getCvPti(pt);
```

Reverse operation as simple as this:
```C++

cv::Point2d ptcv(4,5);
Point2d pt1(ptcv);      // using constructor
Point2d pt2 = ptcv;     // or assignment operator
```
(works the same for `cv::Point2f` and `cv::Point2i`)

Similarly, you can build a line using Opencv points:
```C++
cv::Point2d ptcv(4,5);
Line2d l1( ptcv );                     // line going trough (0,0) and (4,5)
Line2d l2( ptcv, cv::Point2d(8,9) );   // line going trough (4,5) and (8,9)
```


This also enables conversions between matrices types.
You can build a homography using a provided `cv::Mat`:
```C++
cv::Mat m;   // needs to be 3x3, floating point type (either CV_32F or CV_64F)
... // fill m
Homog H = m;  // call of dedicated constructor
H = m;        // or call assignment operator
```



### Drawing functions using OpenCv

You can also directly draw points and lines on an image (`cv::Mat` type):
```C++
Point2d pt( ... );
Line2d li( ... );
li.draw( mat );
pt.draw( mat );
```

These drawing functions support a second optional argument of type `CvDrawParams` that holds various parameters for drawing.
So you can for example set the color and line width with:
```C++
li.draw( mat, CvDrawParams().setThickness(2 /* pixels */).setColor(r,g,b) );
```
with r,g,b as bytes (`uint8_t`) in the range [0,255].

The drawing parameters default values can be changed anytime with a call to `setDefault()`,
and values will be retained, unless explicitely changed, as showed in the example below;

```C++
CvDrawParams dp; // default line thickness is 1
dp.setColor( 0,  0, 250).setThickness(3);
dp.setDefault(); // default is now blue, with thickness=3
line.draw( some_img ); // use default settings
line.draw( some_img. CvDrawParams().setColor( 0,0,0) ); // warning, black, but line thickness=3 !
```

You can at any time return to the "factory" settings with a call to a static function:
```C++
CvDrawParams::resetDefault();
```

You can also draw line segments with the Segment type. It also supports the drawing parameter:
```C++
Segment s1( Point2d(100,100),  Point2d(300,200) );
s1.draw( some_img );                                 // using default style
Segment s2( Point2d(300,100),  Point2d(100,200) );
s2.draw( some_img, CvDrawParams().setColor(0,0,0) ); // black
```

A demo demonstrating this Opencv binding is provided, try it with
`make demo` (requires of course that Opencv is installed on your machine).


## 7 - Numerical data types
<a name="numdt"></a>

### Underlying data type

The library is fully templated, the user has the ability to select for each type either
`float`, `double` or `long double` as underlying numerical datatype, on a per-object basis.

The default datatype used for `Point2d`, `Line2d` or `Homogr` is `double`.
The other types can be selected by an additional suffix letter added after the type:

`F` for `float`, `D` for `double` and `L` for `long double`.

For example: `Point2dF`, `Line2dF` or `HomogrF` are float types.

If you prefer the classical template notation, it is also available by using `Point2d_` and `Line2d_`, which are templated types:

```C++
Point2d_<float> pt; // this is fine
```

### Numerical issues

For the tests on null values and floating-point comparisons, some compromises had to be done.
As you may know, the concept of "equal floating point values" is very tricky.
In this library, this can hurt in several ways:
 - creating a line from two points will fail if the points are equal,
 - similarly, computing a point at the intersection of two lines will fail if the lines are parallel.

This library will ensure these conditions, and will throw an exception (of type `std::runtime_error`) if that kind of thing happens.
The thresholds have default values.
They are implemented as static values, that can be changed any time.

- When checking for parallel lines (see `isParallelTo()`), the "null" angle value has a default value of one thousand of a radian (0.001 rad).
You can print the current value with:
```C++
cout << "default null angle=" << Line2d::nullAngleValue() << " rad.\n";
```
It can be changed any time with the same function, for example:
```C++
Line2d::nullAngleValue() = 0.01;
```
This is checked for when computing an intersection point.

- When attempting to compute a line out of two points, the library will throw if the distance between the two points is less than `Point2d::nullDistance()`.
That same function can be used to change (or print) the current value.

- When attempting to compute the inverse of a matrix, if the determinant is less than `Homogr::nullDeterValue()`, the inversion code will throw.


## 8 - Technical details
<a name="tech"></a>

- The two types `Point2d` and `Line2d` are actually the same class,
behavior differs due to some policy-based design (see below).
- Points are stored as non-normalized values, any computation will keep the resulting values.
Normalization is done for comparison but not saved.
- Lines are always stored as normalized values (a^2+b^2 = 1)
- Homographies are stored as normalized values, either as h33=1, or (if null) as h23=1, or (if null) as h13=1

### Testing

A unit-test program is included, it is build and run with `make test`.
If you have Opencv installed on your machine, you can run the additional tests that make sure the Opencv binding stuff runs fine by passing make option `USE_OPENCV=Y`:
```
make test USE_OPENCV=Y
```

### Build options
<a name="options"></a>

Below are some options that can be passed, to activate them, just define the symbol.
You can do that in the makefile or just add a `#define` on top of your program,
**before** the `#include "homog2d"`

- `HOMOG2D_USE_OPENCV`: enable the Opencv binding, see [Bindings](#bind).
- `HOMOG2D_SAFE_MODE`: this will enable some additional checks in the API. Runtime issues will make functions throw a `std::runtime_error`.


### Inner details

To be able to templatize all the code on the root numerical data type (float, double, ...), we implement some trick.
As the Root class is already templatized on the type (Point or Line),
it would require a partial template specialization to define the behavior of each member function (or free function),
depending on the basic type (Line or Point), and still templatize on the numerical type.
C++ does not allow this |-(.

Thus, the trick here is to call in each function a "sub" private function (prefixed with `impl_`) that gets overloaded
by the datatype (point or line).
To achieve this overloading, each of these functions receives as additional (dummy) argument an object of type RootHelper,
templated by the numerical type.
In the definition of the function, this additional argument value is ignored,
it is there just so that the compiler can select the correct overload
(in a similar way of what happens with templates).

The two implementations (for points and for lines) are written as two `impl_` private functions that are templated by the numerical data type.
If the situation only makes sense for one of the types (for example `getAngle()` cannot be considered for two points), then
the implementation of that type only holds a `static_assert`, so that can be catched at build time.

### Footnotes

[(1)](#paedfapol)
<a name="fn1"></a> The rationale behind this interface is that if we had choosen to pass a point as argument, no guarantee would have been given that the point is effectively lying on the line.
With this function signature, the function can compute the point itself.
