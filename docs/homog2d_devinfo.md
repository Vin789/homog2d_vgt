# Dev information

This page will gather misc. information useful for anyone wanting to contribute to code.

## Introduction

`master` branch is supposed to stay stable, with all tests passing.
`devX` branches are where things happen.

Building tests, demos, showcases, ...: everything is handled through the makefile, using the "out-of-source" principle:
everything that gets build ends up in the `BUILD` folder, and `make clean` cleans it up.

Figures that appear in the manual are of two types
 - LaTeX-Tikz based, located in `docs` folder, see the `.tex` files.
 They are generated with<br>
 `$ make doc_fig_tex`

 - Opencv-based: the programs that builds them are located in `docs/figures_src`.
 They are generated with<br>
 `$ make doc_fig`

The showcase gif images are generated with<br>
 `$ make showcase`<br>
 and require Opencv installed on the system.

Some other figures can be generated, that correspond to some test cases (also requires Opencv).
This is solely to be able to see what is actually tested.
These are located in `misc/figures_test`, as instanciation of two variables `r1` and `r2`.
A valid program generating the image is generated by the makefile with target `test_fig`.
This is done by pasting together the considered file and `misc/figures_test/header.cpp` and
`misc/figures_test/footer.cpp`, then compiling and running the program.


## Coding style

- TABS, not spaces (1 byte per level)
- types have first character upper case, variables are lowercase
- `camelCase` for identifiers
- class member variables are prefixed with an underscore (`_`)
- spaces after parenthesis (`if( someBool )`)
- private and protected member function are prefixed with `p_` (or `impl_` for tag dispatch implementation for points/lines)
- all symbols start with `HOMOG2D_`, to avoid name collisions
